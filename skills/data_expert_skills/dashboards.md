Dashboard 1 — Financial Performance (P&L)

You are an expert financial dashboard engineer and front-end developer.

Your task is to generate a fully functional interactive HTML dashboard based on the CSV dataset that I will upload with this prompt.

The output must be a single self-contained HTML file that I can download and open locally in a browser.

The dashboard should be designed for finance teams and executives to analyze profitability and margin drivers.
