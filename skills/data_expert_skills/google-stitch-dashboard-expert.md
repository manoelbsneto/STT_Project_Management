## Design System Configuration for Executive Dashboards

### Recommended Design System Settings
```json
{
  "displayName": "Executive RFP Dashboard",
  "colorPalette": {
    "primaryColor": "#3B82F6",
    "saturationLevel": "MEDIUM"
  },
  "typography": {
    "fontFamily": "Inter"
  },

    "mode": "DARK",
    "darkModeBackgroundColor": "#0F1117"
  },
  "designMd": "Premium executive dashboard for Fortune 500 RFP analysis. Dark mode with glass-morphism cards. Data-dense but clean. Use blue/purple accent gradients. Status colors: green for positive, amber for warning, red for critical. Large KPI numbers. Subtle animations."
}
```

## Screen Generation Prompts — Best Practices

### Prompt Structure for Stitch
When generating screens via `generate_screen_from_text`, use this structure:

```
[SCREEN TYPE]: [Title]

LAYOUT:
- [Grid/positioning description]

SECTIONS:
1. [Section name]: [detailed description with data types]
2. [Section name]: [detailed description with data types]

STYLE:
- [Color, typography, spacing directives]

DATA:
- [Specific data values to display]
```

### Example Prompts for RFP Dashboard Screens

#### Screen 1: Executive Overview
```
Executive dashboard overview screen for RFP analysis.

HEADER: "RFP Diligence Report — GO/NO-GO" with dark background, company logo placeholder on left, date "2026-04-16" on right, and a large "GO CONDITIONAL" badge in amber.

KPI ROW (5 cards in a row):
- Card 1: "Weighted Score" showing "3.08/5.00" with a circular progress gauge
- Card 2: "Confidence" showing "65%" with a semi-circle gauge
- Card 3: "Contract Value" showing "R$ 16.6M" with green text
- Card 4: "P0 Blockers" showing "4" in red with warning icon
- Card 5: "QA Gates" showing "9/10" with green progress bar

MAIN AREA (2 columns):
- Left (60%): Scorecard table with columns: Dimension, Weight, Score, Weighted, Rationale. Include rows for Strategic Fit, Scope Clarity, Delivery Feasibility, etc. Color-code scores.
- Right (40%): Radar chart showing risk dimensions with colored areas.

BOTTOM ROW (2 columns):
- Left: Risk register table with columns: Risk, Category, Severity badge, Impact
- Right: P0 Blockers list as red-accented cards with owner and deadline

STYLE: Dark mode, glassmorphism cards, Inter font, blue/purple accent gradients, subtle shadows.
```

#### Screen 2: Financial & Sizing
```
Financial analysis dashboard for RFP bid sizing.

HEADER: "Financial Exposure & Sizing Scenarios" with breadcrumb navigation.

TOP ROW (3 cards):
- "Conservative": Lot 1 = 45-60 FTEs, Lot 2 = 50-70 FTEs
- "Base": Lot 1 = 60-80 FTEs, Lot 2 = 70-100 FTEs  
- "Aggressive": Lot 1 = 80-100 FTEs, Lot 2 = 100-140 FTEs

MAIN CHART: Grouped bar chart comparing scenarios across lots.

BOTTOM: Pricing blockers table with severity badges and owner columns.

STYLE: Dark mode, green/amber/red for scenario risk levels.
```

#### Screen 3: Document Processing
```
Document processing and extraction status dashboard.

HEADER: "Document Intelligence Pipeline"

STATS ROW: Total Files: 35, Extracted: 32, Failed: 3, Evidence Entries: 20

MAIN AREA:
- Left: File inventory table with columns: File ID, Name, Type, Status (green/red badge), Method
- Right: Donut chart showing extraction success rate

BOTTOM: QA Gates checklist with pass/fail indicators (10 items, 9 pass, 1 partial)

STYLE: Dark mode, tech/engineering feel, monospace for file names.
```

## Stitch Screen Editing Patterns

### Adding Interactivity
```
Add hover effects to all cards. When hovering, the card should slightly elevate with a shadow. 
Add a tooltip on each KPI showing the calculation methodology.
Make the scorecard table rows highlight on hover with a blue left border.
```

### Refining Aesthetics
```
Make the background darker (#0B0D14). Add a subtle grid pattern overlay at 3% opacity.
Use glassmorphism for all card backgrounds (backdrop-blur: 12px, bg opacity 0.7).
Add a gradient border on the hero KPI card (blue to purple, 1px).
Increase the KPI number font size to 48px and weight to 800.
```

### Adding Data Visualizations
```
Replace the placeholder chart with a spider/radar chart showing 8 dimensions:
Strategic Fit, Scope Clarity, Delivery, Commercial, Legal, Financial, Timeline, Assessment.
Each dimension should have a score from 0-5. Color the fill area blue at 30% opacity.
```

## Device Type Recommendations
- **DESKTOP** — Primary for executive dashboards (1920x1080 target)
- **TABLET** — For presentation mode (iPad landscape)
- **MOBILE** — Not recommended for data-dense executive dashboards

## Variant Generation Strategy

### When to Generate Variants
1. **Layout alternatives** — Try different grid arrangements
2. **Color scheme tests** — Light vs dark, different accent colors
3. **Data density levels** — More cards vs fewer with more detail
4. **Chart type exploration** — Bar vs radar vs heatmap for same data

### Variant Options
```json
{
  "numberOfVariants": 3,
  "creativeRange": "MEDIUM",
  "focusAspects": ["layout", "color", "typography"]
}
```

## Integration with RFP Pipeline Outputs

### Available Data Sources (from output/)
| File | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `executive_summary.json` | Hero KPIs, recommendation badge |
| `9_Go_No_Go_Scorecard_FILLED.csv` | Scorecard table + radar chart |
| `legal_risk_register.json` | Risk matrix / risk table |
| `pricing_and_sizing_blockers.json` | P0 blockers panel |
| `sizing_scenarios.json` | Financial comparison charts |
| `11_Customer_Questions_Pack_FILLED.csv` | Questions queue list |
| `qa_gate_results.json` | QA gates checklist |
| `4_File_Inventory_FILLED.csv` | Document processing table |
| `strategic_fit_assessment.json` | Strategic fit analysis section |
| `delivery_model_recommendation.json` | Delivery model cards |
| `conflicts_register.json` | Conflicts / issues panel |

### Data Mapping Pattern
When designing screens, reference actual data values from these files to make the dashboard realistic and immediately useful.
